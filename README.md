## This Model build up a predicting model based on the vehicle history data

Predictive modeling is the general concept of building a model that is capable of making predictions. Typically, such a model includes a machine learning algorithm that learns certain properties from a training dataset in order to make those predictions.
Predictive modeling can be divided further into two sub areas: Regression and pattern classification. Regression models are based on the analysis of relationships between variables and trends in order to make predictions about continuous variables, e.g., the prediction of the maximum temperature for the upcoming days in weather forecasting.
In contrast to regression models, the task of pattern classification is to assign discrete class labels to particular observations as outcomes of a prediction. To go back to the above example: A pattern classification task in weather forecasting could be the prediction of a sunny, rainy, or snowy day.

To not get lost in all possibilities, the main focus of this article will be on “pattern classification”, the general approach of assigning predefined class labels to particular instances in order to group them into discrete categories. The term “instance” is synonymous to “observation” or “sample” and describes an “object” that consists of one or multiple features (synonymous to “attributes”).

The goal is to predict the departure action and give the driver a warning
